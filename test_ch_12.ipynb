        "## Introduction  \n",
        "In this chapter, we will explore how to transform your machine learning (ML) models from isolated experiments into fully functional, production-ready services by deploying them as RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs). As models progress beyond notebooks and scripts, the need to expose them reliably, often through Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) endpoints, becomes critical for real-world integration.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, we will introduce two of the most widely used Python web frameworks for serving ML models, Flask and FastAPI. You will learn how to build and test endpoints for real-time and batch inference, validate inputs, log predictions, and generate interactive documentation.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond basic deployment, we will also cover how to containerize your API with Docker, making it portable and scalable for use in cloud environments or microservice architectures. By the end of this chapter, you will not only understand how to expose your models as APIs, but also how to do this in the most secure and efficient way possible. This chapter will provide you with the practical skills and patterns needed to bridge the gap between model development and releasing your models to be production-grade inference services.  \n",

You will understand how to validate inputs, structure prediction responses, and automatically generate interactive API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc. You will also gain hands-on experience containerizing your application using Docker for consistent and portable deployment. Finally, you will learn key best practices for production deployment, including monitoring, logging, model versioning, and updating models without downtime.\n",

        "### FastAPI, high-performance framework for production inference  \n",
        "**FastAPI (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** is a modern Python web framework designed for high performance and developer productivity, especially useful for deploying ML models as APIs. It is built on **ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)**, a modern alternative to **WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)**. While WSGI handles one request at a time, which can become a bottleneck under heavy traffic, ASGI supports asynchronous programming, allowing **FastAPI** to handle many requests at once without blocking. This makes it highly efficient for real-time or high-throughput inference scenarios.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**FastAPI** also leverages modern Python features like type annotations. Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you do not have to specify variable types. However, with type annotations, you can add optional *hints* about what type of data a function expects or returns (e.g., int, str, List[float]). **FastAPI** uses these hints, along with libraries like **Pydantic (https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)**, to automatically validate inputs, serialize outputs, and generate clear, interactive documentation, all with minimal extra code.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these features make **FastAPI** a powerful choice for creating fast, scalable, and well-documented APIs, making it especially well-suited for serving ML models in production environments.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Key features for model serving are as follows:  \n",
        "- **Asynchronous request handling**: Ideal for input/output bound tasks such as loading large models or calling external APIs.  \n",
        "- **Automatic input validation**: Using Pydantic reduces the chance of errors during inference.  \n",
        "- **Built-in Swagger UI and ReDoc**: Built-in Swagger UI **(https://swagger.io/)** and ReDoc **(https://redocly.com/docs/redoc)** enable auto-generating API docs that make testing and debugging easier.  \n",
        "- **High throughput and low latency**: Suitable for real-time (one request at a time) or batch inference (uploading data in batches) in production environments.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**FastAPI** is ideal when serving deep learning models, running real-time predictions, or deploying at scale behind load balancers or in containerized environments like Docker and Kubernetes.  \n",
        "\n",
        "When deploying ML models as APIs, **Flask** and **FastAPI** are both strong candidates. Flask offers a fast path to deployment for simple models and use cases, while FastAPI provides better performance, maintainability, and support for modern Python features, making it ideal for production-grade inference services. If you are experimenting or building proof-of-concept, Flask might be all you need, but if you are planning to scale, handle concurrent requests, or serve latency-sensitive models, FastAPI is the clear winner.\n",

In simple terms, a RESTful API organizes communication between systems around **resources** (like `/predict`) and **actions** (like sending a POST request). The main types of methods used in RESTful endpoints are explained hereunder:  \n",
        "- **GET** is used to retrieve data from the server. We will use this in our endpoint to get a health status.  \n",

        "- **PUT** is used to update or replace an existing resource, such as updating a user’s profile. This is used for managing model versioning or settings via an API.  \n",
        "- **DELETE** is used to delete a resource on the server, such as deleting an account, record, or file. This is seldom used for inference endpoints.  \n",
